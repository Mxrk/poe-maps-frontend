# Poe-Maps Trading
This is the frontend for a tool to trade maps with other people in the game "path of exile". I would recommend doing the tutorial on the page if you're new.

# development
## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

sort.py is also interesting for building new assets. You can add more values to each map which could potentially add more/different information to the page.

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
